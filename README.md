# NLP_for_Disaster_Tweet_Classification

This project aims to classify disaster-related tweets into 2 categories (real/fake). To achieve this, I have used 2 Machine learning models and a Deep Learning model. Machine Leaning models (Logistic Regression & Decision trees) gave poor accuracy in comparison to the Deep Learning model (CNN). I have also done comparitive analysis of 4 different optimizers (Adam, AdaGrad, SGD and RMSprop) to choose the best optimizer that yields the best performance. I've performed hyperparameter tuning and made use of Bert embeddings as well.
